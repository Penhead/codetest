# codetest

###Init Project  
first run these commands  
npm install  
bower install  

###Side notes
I chose to keep it simple and as pure the angular as possible. So my dependencies are minimal.  
I'm using AngularJs for my application framework,   
ui-router to handle routing,  
Foundation 6 as my css framework,  
I included animate css to handle my simple animations for fading.

###Testing 
I'm using karma, jasmine, and angular-mocks.
In order to run test
